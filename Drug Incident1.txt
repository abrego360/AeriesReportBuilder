--Drug Incident Counts 1-4
--Our school is implementing a new program where drug offenses are handled with a progressive disciplinary approach. This program tracks every drug incident with the following steps:

--First Drug Incident: The student will participate in a drug educational rehab program. This incident will not result in suspension.
--Second Drug Incident: The student will receive a suspension.
--Third Drug Incident: The student will undergo further counseling in addition to receiving a suspension.
--Fourth Drug Incident: The student will face expulsion.
--To implement and manage this program, backend access in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is required. The following query can be used to track and manage these incidents:
